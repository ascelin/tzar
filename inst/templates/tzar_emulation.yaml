    #  Controls for when you are running tzar emulations inside
    #  a build process for building a package.
    #
    #  In that case, you can't have tzar's required "model.R" file in
    #  the R directory because R's Build process will run it when it
    #  runs all R files in the directory.
    #  - If not emulating inside a Build process,
    #      - set copy_model_dot_R_tzar_file to FALSE to indicate that model.R
    #        is in the source directory and should be left alone.
    #      - The 4 variables after that one are ignored when it is FALSE.
    #  - If emulating inside a Build process,
    #      - set copy_model_dot_R_tzar_file to TRUE to indicate that model.R
    #        must be hidden under a different name during Builds and then
    #        unhidden when running an emulation.
    #      - The 4 variables after that must be set, though the default values
    #        here in the template are usually fine, except for the overwrite
    #        variable.  You will probably want to set it to TRUE so that you
    #        don't have to manually delete a leftover model.R after a crash,
    #        but the default here in the template is FALSE to make sure that
    #        you don't accidentally overwrite a good model.R before you
    #        understand what's going on.
